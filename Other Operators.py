# AND Operator

print(y>x and x<=10) # true
print(x==y and x==10) # true


# Both operands should be true so that the outcome could come true, if one operand is false then the whole statement is false.

# OR Operator

print (y>x or x<y) # true
print (x<=10 or y<=20 ) #true
print (x==30 or y!=20) #true

# One  operands should be true, if both operand is false then the whole statement is false.

# Not Operator

print(x!=10) # true
print(x==10) # false

# An operand should be false to become true and false to become true, in short it is just the oposite.
